			<h4>Do not Give Up!</h4>
			<p>There is a reason you wanted to start coding so when you feel like you want to give up, go back to that reason and keep on going!</p>

			<p>It is going to get tough at times and you will have doubts as to whether this is something you are capable of doing. That is totally normal. As long as you continue with the problem you are trying to solve and get yourself through it, you will be able to prove yourself wrong later on.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>The more questions you find yourself asking, the more you are learning.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
